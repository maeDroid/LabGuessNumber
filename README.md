# LabGuessNumber
# Friday Oct 2 2015

Goals of the lab:  
  1) Learn to pass data from one activity to a second activity
  2) Learn how to return to the first (calling) activity
  
The app is a simple game that randomly picks a number between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
and has a player make a number of guesses until the correct number is guessed.  When
the player guesses the correct number, the game redirects to a second activity that 
shows the number of attempts the player took to correctly guess the number.

    - how many games played
    - average number of guesses made
- allow resetting of stats
